# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This project is a web-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to interact through buttons, displays the current score, and announces the winner when one player reaches 5 points.

## Features
1. **Button-Based Player Input**:
   - Players choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking buttons instead of typing input.
   
2. **Game Logic**:
   - Each button click initiates a round with the selected option.
   - The game compares the playerâ€™s choice against a randomly generated computer choice to determine the round winner.

3. **Score Tracking and Winner Announcement**:
   - A running score is displayed on the page.
   - The game announces a winner when either player or computer reaches 5 points.

4. **Result Display**:
   - All results and messages are shown directly on the webpage using DOM manipulation instead of console logs.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click a button (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to play a round.
3. The game displays the results of each round and updates the score.
4. Play until one player reaches 5 points to win the game.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the game interface.
- **CSS through Javascript**: For styling the buttons and results display.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic, score tracking, and event handling.

## How to Run
